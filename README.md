# AlterAPI
Alter-API is an application where you can test your API.

Quickly and easily requests directly within Alter-API. Automate manual tests and Communicate the expected behavior of an API by simulating endpoints.

## Demo : [Alter-API](https://deeps8.github.io/AlterAPI-Tester)

## Near future plans ✈
I want to add some features to application which will make it much more reliable and approachable to all.

- Implementing user authentication system.
- Give user to make collection of similar API's and save API, responses and can make API documentation.
- Convert it into an Extension.

## Inspiration ⭐
When ever I'm working with API's , I always use Postman .
So I thought to make my own API testing app. This application might not be good as Postman but by building these types of app I learn a lot.

So why not try it ! ✌
